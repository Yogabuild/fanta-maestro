# `fanta-maestro`

Fanta Maestro, a fantasy game about football where participants must organize and manage virtual teams, gives the opportunity to choose not only players from Serie A, but also from Serie B.

Fantasy Football is an institution in Italy. Interesting potential for II adoption.

On II login : join a league of friends or create a new league and invite friends to join by adding their emails (max x emails).

App windows : My team, Teams ranking & access to all team rosters, Calendar for the year, Rules.

Every Friday we have to organise a lineup with 11 starting players and 14 bench players: Choose a formation for next game: 4-4-2, 4-3-3, ... Latest chosen formation should be pre-selected. Choose the players and place them on the pitch or on the bench.

Friends get together for a full season by betting an amount (ex: 200â‚¬). The winner gets the bet, or a podium shares the amount.
